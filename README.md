## Project Overview

I designed and implemented an end-to-end ETL pipeline to ingest raw CSV data and load it into a relational database after performing necessary data cleaning and transformations.

I created detailed database documentation, clearly defining the schema, tables, keys, and relationships to ensure data integrity and easy understanding for future use.

Using SQL, I answered specific business queries by writing optimized queries to extract meaningful insights and support decision-making.

I analyzed product data requirements and implemented NoSQL solutions using MongoDB, designing collections and writing queries suited for flexible and scalable data storage.

Finally, I built a data warehouse using a star schema, defining fact and dimension tables, and generated analytical reports to support high-level business analysis and reporting.
