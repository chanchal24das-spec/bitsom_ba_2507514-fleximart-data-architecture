# Assignment Overview

## FlexiMart NoSQL Analysis & MongoDB Implementation

This assignment focuses on evaluating the suitability of **NoSQL databases**, specifically MongoDB, for managing a highly diverse and evolving product catalog at FlexiMart. The tasks are designed to help me understand the limitations of traditional relational databases in such scenarios and to gain hands-on experience with MongoDB’s flexible, document-based data model.

The assignment is divided into two main tasks that together cover both **theoretical understanding** and **practical implementation** of NoSQL concepts.

## Task 2.1: NoSQL Justification Report

In this task, I analyzed why a traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) may not be ideal for handling FlexiMart’s expanding and diverse product catalog. The analysis highlights challenges such as managing products with varying attributes, handling frequent schema changes when new product types are introduced, and storing complex nested data like customer reviews.

I then explored how MongoDB addresses these challenges through its flexible schema design, support for embedded documents, and horizontal scalability. The task also includes a balanced discussion of trade-offs, identifying realistic disadvantages of MongoDB when compared to MySQL. This section demonstrates my conceptual understanding of when and why NoSQL databases are preferred in modern, data-driven applications.

## Task 2.2: MongoDB Implementation

In this task, I applied the theoretical concepts by implementing basic MongoDB operations using a sample product catalog dataset. I worked with JSON-based product documents containing nested specifications and customer reviews, reflecting real-world e-commerce data structures.

The implementation includes loading data into MongoDB, querying products by category and price, analyzing customer reviews using aggregation pipelines, updating documents by adding new embedded reviews, and performing complex aggregations such as calculating average price by category. This task demonstrates my ability to work with MongoDB collections, queries, updates, and aggregations in a practical scenario.

## Overall Learning Outcome

Through these tasks, I gained a clear understanding of the strengths and limitations of NoSQL databases and practical experience in using MongoDB for flexible and scalable data storage. This assignment enhanced my ability to choose appropriate database technologies based on business requirements and to implement real-world data operations using modern NoSQL tools.
